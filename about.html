        <p class="name">GIULIA FRANI</p>
        <p>
          Italian actress between London and italy. I bring to the stage a
          genuine energy and a direct gaze. My work moves between theater of the
          absurd and experimentation, with a flexible voice and a stage presence
          hone by experience.

          Giulia Frani is an Italian-born actor and playwright shaping a
          creative life between the UK and Italy. <br />Her work lives at the
          intersection of language, culture, and performance — bold, borderless,
          and driven by story. <br />
          Alongside acting, Giulia is an emerging playwright whose work explores
          human connection, identity, and the spaces between cultures.
        </p>
        <p class="column-2-item-2">
          Giulia began her training in 2016 at the
          <strong>Film Academy (I.F.A.)</strong> in Pescara, studying acting for
          camera and stage under industry professionals including Zulima Memba,
          Marco Cassini, Daniele Ciglia, and Ludovico Fremont. <br />In 2019,
          Giulia moved to London to deepen her craft, attending short courses at
          <strong>The Unseen</strong> with Arjun Rose and the
          <strong>London Actors Workshop</strong> with Daniel Dresner and Jon
          Sidgwick.
