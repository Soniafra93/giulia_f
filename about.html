        <p class="name">GIULIA FRANI</p>
        <p>
          Italian actress between London and italy. I bring to the stage a
          genuine energy and a direct gaze. My work moves between theater of the
          absurd and experimentation, with a flexible voice and a stage presence
          hone by experience.

          Giulia Frani is an Italian-born actor and playwright shaping a
          creative life between the UK and Italy. <br />Her work lives at the
          intersection of language, culture, and performance â€” bold, borderless,
          and driven by story. <br />She began her training in 2016 at the
          International Film Academy (I.F.A.) in Pescara, studying acting for
          camera and stage under industry professionals including Zulima Memba,
          Marco Cassini, Daniele Ciglia, and Ludovico Fremont. <br />During this
          time, she took on leading roles in Waiting for Godot and Girotondo
          Cabaret with I.F.A. Productions. <br />In 2019, Giulia moved to London
          to deepen her craft, attending short courses at The Unseen with Arjun
          Rose and the London Actors Workshop with Daniel Dresner and Jon
          Sidgwick. <br />That same year, she performed in Infidelities, marking
          her UK stage debut. <br />In 2023, she joined Medley Theatre Company
          and starred as the main character in A Tailor for Ladies at The
          Cockpit Theatre. <br />Alongside acting, Giulia is an emerging
          playwright whose work explores human connection, identity, and the
          spaces between cultures.
